CLASS - a template (shape of an OBJECT)

METHOD (or Message) - A defined capability of a CLASS
METHODs are these things that are functions built into OBJECTs.

ATTRIBUTE (or field)  - a bit of data in CLASS

OBJECT (or Instance) - A particular instance of a CLASS


OBJECTS - str, int, list, dict, float, soup etc
An OBJECT is a bit of self-conatined code and data
A key aspect of the OBJECT approach is to break the problem into smaller understandable parts.
From outside looking in (OBJECT), you ignore the detail. From inside looking out, you ignore the outer detail
